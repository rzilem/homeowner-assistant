### "Downloaded" instead of "Copied"

This happens when:

- Clipboard permission blocked

**What to do:**
1. Find `answer.png` in your Downloads folder
2. Attach it to your email manually

### Enable Clipboard in Chrome/Edge

1. Click the lock icon (left of URL)
2. Find "Clipboard"
3. Change to "Allow"
4. Refresh the page

### Image Won't Paste

- Make sure you're using Ctrl+V
- Right-click paste may not work
- Try clicking in email body first

## What the Image Contains

When you copy, the image includes:
- Your search question (in quotes at top)
- The AI answer (large bold text)
- Source quote (if found in documents)
- Green gradient styling

It does NOT include:
- The "Copy for Email" button
- The "Answer Found" header

## Quick Tips

1. **Use Edge or Chrome** - Other browsers have issues
2. **Always Ctrl+V** - Don't right-click to paste
3. **Check clipboard permissions** - May need to allow once
4. **Download fallback works** - If copy fails, file downloads automatically
